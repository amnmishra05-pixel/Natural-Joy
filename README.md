# Natural Joy

Natural Joy is a front-end e-commerce website designed for customers to explore and purchase a wide variety of natural fruit juices. The site offers a clean and responsive user interface with multiple pages showcasing products, special deals, flavors, favorites, and a shopping cart experience.

**This project is currently built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — focusing on layout, design, and user interaction. While all pages and UI components are fully functional on the front end, **the Backend is still under development.** Once complete, features like user authentication, cart persistence, order processing, and database integration will be added.
